# 好きこそ物の上手なれ  - A humble Japanese learning site

A blog-style website ([link](https://jouzunare.neocities.org/)) where I share my thoughts on Japanese language-learning. Topics include kanji, vocabulary, grammar, idioms, etc. This site is hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).

Please feel free to reach out to me at howard.li.2718@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments.
